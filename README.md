# Social_Network
In today's world, social networks have a certain scope and are available at all cultural levels and in all societies. Social networks are not a new concept; People have been forming social networks since centuries
ago when they sat around the fire and told each other stories.

In this project, we are also planning to create a social network for the communication of students around the world, like the LinkedIn program.
